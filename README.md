This is my Statistics master project on Bresat Cancer Data. Along with some homework course projects of Data Mining course.

In this project, three different linear discriminators(linear regression, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression) are applied on a binomial response data. Dimension of the data is reduced after processed by PCA and FDA and only two scores are retained. To get more insights, training set and test set are switched and some other linear regressions discriminators are played upon this data.
